 AI Study Planner for Engineering Students
 
Problem

Engineering students struggle to allocate limited study time across multiple complex subjects with different cognitive loads, prerequisites, and deadlines. Traditional planners are static and non-adaptive.

Solution

This project is an AI-powered adaptive study planner that:

Prioritizes subjects based on weak areas, confidence level, and credits

Classifies study sessions by cognitive load (High / Medium / Low)

Generates an actionable, day-wise study plan

Provides a 7-day focus summary and outcome-oriented insights

Key Features

Personalized subject prioritization

Cognitive load–aware planning

Weak-topic-first strategy
Explainable AI decisions (“why this subject now”)

Actionable 7-day focus summary

Tech Stack
