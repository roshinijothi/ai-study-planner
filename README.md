Problem:
Engineering students struggle to allocate limited study time across multiple complex subjects with different cognitive loads, prerequisites, and deadlines. Traditional planners are static and non-adaptive.

Solution:
.This project is an AI-powered adaptive study planner that prioritizes subjects based on weak areas, confidence level, and credits
.Classifies study sessions by cognitive load (High / Medium / Low)
.Generates an actionable, day-wise study plan
.Provides a 7-day focus summary and outcome-oriented insights

Key Features:
.Personalized subject prioritization
.Cognitive load–aware planning
.weak-topic-first strategy
.Explainable AI decisions (“why this subject now”)

Actionable 7-day focus summary:
Tech Stack
python 3
Rule-based AI logic (heuristics)
VS Code

How to Run:
python planner.py

Sample Output:
Day-wise study plan with focus topic and cognitive load
7-day key focus areas
expected learning outcomes

Future Improvements:
>Adaptive re-planning based on progress
>weekend vs weekday scheduling
>web-based UI dashboard
